Emacs grand unified debugger interface to Windows kernel debugger (kd.exe) 
==========================================================================

The problem
-----------
Unfortunately gud mangles input string of type tcp:Port=<port>,Server=<host>; 
So the only way to connect to remote kd session (so far found) is to use simple cmd wrapper to pass over these arguments to KD.

Setup
-----
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/cdb-kd")
    (load cdb-gud)

Use should also have kd.exe in your path:

    (setenv "PATH"
            (concat 
                "C:\\path\\to\windbg"
                (getenv "PATH")))

(add-to-list 'exec-path "C:\\path\\to\windbg")


Usage
-----
M-x kd-remote

It will ask for <port> and <host>,
for example you could enter 64429 DEVELOP-MACHINE

It is also possible to view current stack.
Just call M-x speedbar and when in gud prompt it will show current function call hierarchy.
